For Espressif Systems

github.com/mahavirj/esp-jumpstart This work is the culmination of years
of learning in IoT product development across a wide team of engineers
at Espressif. The content started off as official training material.
Given the success of the trainings in getting products off the ground,
the material has subsequently been converted to this format. Feel free
to make copies and share. *First release, 2018*

For the restless
================

XXX Consider moving this to the start of the book For the restless, here
are the quick steps and pointers to additional information.

#. Get Jumpstart, IDF repositories and setup your host

#. Read on the usage of the GPIO driver and then create a push-button
   ([sec:push\_button]) action that drives an output GPIO ([sec:relay])

#. Use the unified provisioning API to get the devices on the user’s
   Wi-Fi network ([sec:unified\_prov]). This will store the Wi-Fi name
   and password in NVS

#. Use the reference phone-app (iOS/Android) libraries or apps for
   building your phone applications

#. Implement the *Reset to Factory Settings* by erasing the Wi-Fi
   credentials stored in NVS ([sec:reset\_to\_factory])
