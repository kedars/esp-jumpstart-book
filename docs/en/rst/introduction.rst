ESP-Jumpstart: Build ESP32 Products Fast
----------------------------------------

Building production-ready firmware can be hard. It involves multiple
questions and decisions about the best ways of doing things. It involves
building phone applications, and integrating cloud agents to get all the
features done. What if there was a ready reference, a known set of best
steps, gathered from previous experience of others, that you could
jumpstart with?

ESP-Jumpstart is focused on building *products* on ESP32. It is a
quick-way to get started into your product development process.
ESP-Jumpstart builds a fully functional, ready to deploy “Smart Power
Outlet” in a sequence of incremental tutorial steps. Each step addresses
either a user-workflow or a developer workflow. Each step is an
application built with ESP-IDF, ESP32’s software development framework.

   Smart Power Outlet

The ESP-Jumpstart’s Smart Power Outlet firmware assumes the device has
one input push-button, and one GPIO output. It implements the following
commonly required functionality.

-  Allows and end-user to configure their home Wi-Fi network through
   phone applications (iOS/Android)

-  Switch on or off the GPIO output

-  Use a push-button to physically toggle this output

-  Allow remote control of this output through a cloud

-  Implement over-the-air (OTA) firmware upgrade

-  Perform *Reset to Factory* settings on long-press of the push-button

Once you are familiar with ESP-Jumpstart, building your production
firmware, is a matter of replacing the power-outlet’s device driver,
with your device driver (bulb, washing machine).

   Jumpstart Applicability

You will require the following to get started:

-  An ESP32 development kit: ESP32-DevKit-C
   https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32-devkitc/overview
   available through your closest store. You could also use any other
   ESP32 development board if you already have one.

-  A Development host setup (Windows, Linux or Mac) that will be used
   for development.

For ESP8266 Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will require the following to get started:

-  An ESP8266 development kit: ESP8266-DevKit-C
   https://www.espressif.com/products/hardware/esp8266ex/overview/
   available through your closest store. You could also use any other
   ESP8266 development board if you already have one.

-  ESP8266\_RTOS\_SDK is Espressif’s IoT Development Framework for
   ESP8266
   (https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp8266-rtos-sdk/en/latest). All
   references to IDF, ESP-IDF are to be mapped to ESP8266\_RTOS\_SDK in
   the context of ESP8266.

-  The instructions for ESP32 and ESP8266 are common unless specified
   under the **For ESP8266 Users** section.

For the Restless
----------------

If you are familiar with Espressif’s hardware and/or embedded systems,
and are looking for a production-reference without the incremental
steps, you can do the following:

#. Directly use the final application in ESP-Jumpstart

#. If you don’t have a cloud account, configure your AWS IoT Cloud
   configuration as mentioned in Section :ref:`sec_aws\_cloud`

#. Create the manufacturing configuration file for your device’s unique
   cloud credentials, based on the instructions provided in Section
   :ref:`sec_gen\_factory\_data` and flash it at the appropriate location

#. Build, flash and boot up the firmware image as you usually do

#. Use the reference phone-app (iOS/Android) libraries for building your
   phone applications. Or use the reference application to try things
   out as discussed in Section :ref:`sec_unified\_prov`

#. Use the commands discussed in Section :ref:`sec_aws\_cloud` for remote
   control

#. Now that you have this functional, modify to work with your driver
