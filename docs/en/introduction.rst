ESP-Jumpstart: Build ESP32 Products Fast
----------------------------------------

Building production-ready firmware can be hard. It involves multiple
questions and decisions about the best ways of doing things. It involves
building phone applications, and integrating cloud agents to get all the
features done. What if there was a ready reference, a known set of best
steps, gathered from previous experience of others that you could
jumpstart with?

ESP-Jumpstart is focused on building ’products’ on ESP32. It is a
quick-way to get started into your product development process.
ESP-Jumpstart builds a fully functional, ready to deploy “Smart Power
Outlet” in a sequence of incremental tutorial steps. Each step addresses
either a user-workflow or a developer workflow. Each step is an
application built with ESP-IDF, ESP32’s software development framework.

Building your production firmware, is simply a matter of replacing the
power-outlet’s device driver, with your device driver (bulb, washing
machine).
