ESP-Jumpstart: Build ESP32 Products Fast
----------------------------------------

ESP-Jumpstart is focused on building ’products’ on ESP32. It is a
quick-way to get started into your product development process.
ESP-Jumpstart builds a fully functional, ready to deploy “Smart Power
Outlet” in a sequence of incremental steps. Each step addresses either a
user-workflow or a developer workflow.

And best of all, you need not be an IoT or ESP expert for using
ESP-Jumpstart. All you need is:

-  An ESP32 development kit: ESP32-DevitKit-C (Available on DigiKey,
   Mouser, Amazon)

-  A Development setup
   (https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/)

Once you have ESP-Jumpstart functional, adapting it is simply a matter
of replacing the power-outlet’s device driver, with your device driver
(bulb, washing machine).
